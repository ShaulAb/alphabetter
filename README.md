# alphabetter

The goal of alphabetter is to easily sort code sections alphabetically.

## Example

In my code I always have `setups` section which includes imports and constants.

``` r
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

FIG_WIDTH = 750L
DATA_PATH = "./data"
```

You can alphabetize the above code by selecting relevant lines and apply the addin

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)

DATA_PATH = "./data"
FIG_WIDTH = 750L
```
